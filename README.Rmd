## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model for diagnosing heart disease. We're using the [UCI Heart Disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) dataset, which is publicly available and includes patient data related to heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset includes 14 attributes:

1. Age: age in years
2. Sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. CP: chest pain type
4. TRESTBPS: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. CHOL: serum cholesterol in mg/dl
6. FPS: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. RESTECG: resting electrocardiographic results
8. THALACH: maximum heart rate achieved
9. EXANG: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. OLDPEAK: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. SLOPE: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. CA: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. THAL: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14. TARGET: diagnosis of heart disease (1 = true; 0 = false)

## Methodology

We'll be applying various data analysis and machine learning techniques in R to achieve our goal. The specific steps include:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Optimization

## Results

Results will be updated upon project completion.

```{r, include = FALSE}

The goal of healthdata is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
